# AWS-SES-SEND-MAIL-REST-SERVICE
Email Send example via AWS Simple Email Service


Just call the service from the URL localhost:8080/mail/send

In the AWS SES sandbox mode, FROM,TO,CC mail addresses have to be registered in the AWS SES Service.
You can do it from AWS SES Console.

If you want to send mail to all email address in the world,you can put your SES service out of the sandbox mode.

I described here how to put account out of sandbox mode
